Below is an example README structure you could use for a new GitHub repository showcasing an Arduino project where you use an LM35 sensor to read temperature and then (for demonstration) predict humidity on the Arduino itself—displaying results on the Serial Monitor.

You can adapt the text as needed for your specific requirements, code, and hardware setup.

# Arduino LM35 Temperature-to-Humidity Prediction

This project demonstrates using an LM35 temperature sensor and a deployed machine learning model on an Arduino to **predict humidity** based solely on sensed temperature readings. The Arduino then outputs the predictions to the Serial Monitor.

> **Note**: This is primarily a demonstration of embedded machine learning / inference on a microcontroller. Predicting humidity from only temperature in real-world environments may not be accurate. You would normally need additional environmental variables (e.g., actual humidity sensor, pressure, or location data).

## Overview

- **Project Name:** IoT Arduino LM35 Temperature-to-Humidity Prediction  
- **Objective:** Read temperature from an LM35 sensor, run a lightweight ML model on the Arduino to estimate humidity, and print the results on the Serial Monitor.  
- **Primary Components:** Arduino (e.g. Arduino Uno), LM35 sensor, optional breadboard and jumper wires.

### Why LM35 + ML for Humidity?
This project serves as an educational example of how to do on-device inference (tinyML) with minimal hardware. In a normal scenario, you would use a dedicated humidity sensor. Here, we demonstrate the concept of generating predictions from *other correlated data points* (in this case, temperature).

---

## Features
- **Lightweight ML Model**: A small regression/ML model is stored in the Arduino code to map temperature to a hypothetical humidity value.  
- **Real-Time Inference**: The Arduino reads temperature from the LM35 sensor and immediately feeds it to the model to get a humidity prediction.  
- **Serial Monitor Output**: The temperature and predicted humidity are printed to the Serial Monitor for easy viewing.  
- **Easy Setup**: Just a simple wiring setup between the LM35 and Arduino.

## Hardware and Software Requirements
1. **Arduino Board** (e.g., Arduino Uno, Nano, or similar).  
2. **LM35 Temperature Sensor**.  
3. **USB Cable** to connect Arduino to your computer.  
4. **Jumpers/Wires** and an optional **breadboard** for easy connections.  
5. **Arduino IDE** (or PlatformIO, etc.) installed on your computer.  
6. **C/C++ compiler** (automatically included with Arduino IDE installations).  

**Optional**: If you’re training your model separately (e.g., in Python), you’ll need Python and any ML libraries you use (TensorFlow, scikit-learn, etc.) for the training phase.

## Circuit Diagram

A typical LM35 has 3 pins:  
1. **VCC** (5V)  
2. **Output** (Analog out)  
3. **GND**  

```
         +5V
          |
         ( ) LM35
          |
A0 <------( ) Output
          |
GND <---- ( ) GND
```

- Connect the **VCC pin** on LM35 to the **5V pin** on the Arduino.  
- Connect the **Output pin** on LM35 to the **A0 analog input** on the Arduino.  
- Connect the **GND pin** on LM35 to one of the Arduino **GND** pins.

## Installation

1. **Clone this repository** (once it’s created on GitHub):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/heathbrew/arduino-lm35-humidity-prediction.git
   ```
2. **Open the project** in the Arduino IDE:
   - Launch the Arduino IDE.
   - Go to **File > Open...** and navigate to the `Model/MoisturePrediction/` folder. Select the `.ino` file.

3. **Verify and Upload**:
   - In the Arduino IDE, click the checkmark (Verify) to compile.
   - Select your board and port under **Tools** > **Board** and **Tools** > **Port**.
   - Click the arrow (Upload) to program the Arduino.

## Model Explanation

1. **Model Training (Offline)**  
   - We assume you collected temperature-humidity pairs using some real sensor or a dataset (for demonstration).  
   - You trained a simple regression model (linear regression, polynomial regression, or a small neural network) that takes `temperature` as input and predicts `humidity`.  
   - The final model’s parameters get exported or hardcoded into the Arduino code.

2. **On-Device Inference**  
   - In the Arduino code, you’ll see a function like `float predictHumidity(float temp)` which contains the model’s math (weights, biases, or regression equation).  
   - Each time `loop()` reads a new temperature value from the LM35, it calls `predictHumidity(temp)` and prints the result to the Serial Monitor.

**Example Linear Model** (Pseudo-code):
```cpp
float predictHumidity(float temp) {
  // Suppose we have a linear model humidity = a*temp + b
  // After training offline, let's say a = 0.75, b = 10
  return (0.75 * temp) + 10.0;
}
```

## Usage

1. **Connect the Arduino** to your computer via USB.  
2. **Open the Serial Monitor** from the Arduino IDE (or use a serial terminal) at `9600` baud (or whatever baud rate you set in `setup()`).
3. **Observe the Output**:
   - The Arduino will repeatedly print lines like:
     ```
     Temperature: 25.10 C
     Predicted Humidity: 484 %
     ```
   - Adjust the temperature input (e.g., by touching the LM35 sensor, changing ambient temperature, etc.) and see how the predicted humidity changes.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **No Serial Output**:
  - Make sure the correct **COM port** is selected in the Arduino IDE.
  - Ensure the **baud rate** in the Serial Monitor matches the `Serial.begin()` value in the code.
  
- **Unrealistic Humidity Values**:
  - Check your model’s accuracy or the range of training data.  
  - Confirm that the LM35 is wired correctly and providing correct temperature readings.

- **Compile/Upload Errors**:
  - Confirm you have the right **Board** selected in the Arduino IDE (e.g., Arduino Uno).
  - Check that no other Serial Monitor sessions or tools are blocking the COM port.
